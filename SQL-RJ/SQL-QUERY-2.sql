-- NORMALIZATION IS A SET OF RULES. THERE ARE THREE NORMALIZATION FORMS. THERE MAY BE 4NF, 5NF, ...NNF BUT BASIC ARE THREE.
-- FIRST NORMALIZATION FROM (1NF): NO DUPLICATES OR REDUNDANT DATA AND FRIMARY KEY SHOULD BE THERE
-- SECOND NORMALIZATION FROM (2NF): PRIMARY KEY SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT PARTIALLY ON ANY COLUMNS OR FIELDS
--- THIRD NORMALIZATION FROM (3NF): THERE SHOULD BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TABLES.
